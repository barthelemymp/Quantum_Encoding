# Quantum_Encoding

This repo contains the work done at FU on the idea of finding a better encoding for classical data into a quatum state.

# Directory structure

*report.pdf
  * contains a detailed explanation of the project and some results

* code
  * contains python files with the different function used to implement this new encoding

*Results
   * CNOT : results of the encoding with CNOT as entangling gate
   * CRX : results of the encoding with CRX as entangling gate	
   * CRX_1layer : results of the encoding with CRX as entangling gate and a one layer classical NN as a preprocessing of the data
